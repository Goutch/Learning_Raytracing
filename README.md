# SVO Ray tracer

This project is a **PROTOTYPE** of a sparse voxel octree Ray tracer with opengl compute shaders

It is used to compare multiple sparse voxel octree data structures implementation and their performances implications.

The rendering is meant to be ported to [HellbenderEngine](https://github.com/Goutch/HellbenderEngine) in the future. 

This prototype is heavly inspired by this [paper](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2010-02_Efficient-Sparse-Voxel/laine2010tr1_paper.pdf)
