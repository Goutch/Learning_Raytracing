# SVO Ray tracer

This project is a **PROTOTYPE** of a sparse voxel octree Ray tracer with opengl compute shaders, the rendering is meant to be ported to HellbenderEngine in the future. 

This prototype is heavly inspired by this [paper](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2010-02_Efficient-Sparse-Voxel/laine2010tr1_paper.pdf)
